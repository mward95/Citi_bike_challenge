https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/matthew7863/viz/SummerCitibikes/Story2?publish=yes

## Background

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.



## Instructions
In this data we will be looking at the Jersey City bike locations during the Summer months (June, July, August)
1. Which gender on average would have a longer bike distance and duration?

2. What are the most popular Start and End sattions based of user type and gender?

During the Summer of 2016 in Jersey City the most common user was a subscriber and second was your customer type. Now based on gender males where more likely to use the bike service compared to females. For males the most common start and end location was Grove St Path.For Females as well the most common start and end location was Grove St Path.


3. Create <mark>one</mark> of the following visualizations for city officials:

## Considerations

<mark>Remember, the people reading your analysis will NOT be data analysts.</mark> Your audience will be city officials, public administrators, and heads of New York City municipal departments. Your data and analysis need to be presented in a way that is focused, concise, easy to understand, and visually compelling. Your visualizations should be colorful enough to be included in press releases, and your analysis should be thoughtful enough to inform programmatic changes. 

## Submission 

<mark>Your final submission should include:</mark>

* A link to your Tableau Public workbook that includes the following:
  * 4–10 total "phenomenon" visualizations 
  * 2 dashboards
  * 1 city official map
  * 1 story 
  * A text or markdown file with your analysis of the phenomena you uncovered in the data.


## Assessment

Your final product will be assessed on the following metrics:

* Analytic Rigor

* Readability

* Visual Appeal
